# Final-Project

## Description
Are you tired of viewing jobs on job boards that include tons of requirements, many of which are not relevant to the job? Are you tired of posting your job online with the single goal of only reaching as many applicants as possible. I have a solution to both of these problems. Allow me to introduce my fresh job board. Instead of searching for for jobs by using key words, you can view all jobs that are available from a small list that is focused specifically on your industry. Instead of posting jobs using big keywords, you can now post a job with your basic requirements knowing that the only people who will see it will be people in the tech community. Unlike other job websites that list all types of jobs, my fresh job board is geared specifically to people in the tech community and the employers looking to hire people for these jobs. Employers can easily post jobs and view the resumes and information of everyone who has applied to their jobs. Potential employees are able to view all jobs available and apply to as many as they want. By focusing specifically on the tech field, my fresh job board allows for much less clutter and opens the door to match the right employee with the right job.
